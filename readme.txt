== Description ==

Plugin to make qTranslate work with GravityForms. No more need to duplicate forms for each language.

In order to use you need both qTranslate and GravityForms installed.

After it is installed, you can use the qTranslate quicktags (see http://www.qianqin.de/qtranslate/forum/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=3&p=15#p15) for your field names, confirmation messages, etc.

e.g. if you use "[:en]Your name[:de]Ihr Name[:lb]Ã„ren Numm" as a label, qTranslate - with the help of this plugin - will automatically choose the correct language (in this example either English, German or Luxembourgish) when displaying the form.
